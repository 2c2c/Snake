# snake

simple snake game in pure C

note: C sux

second note: wrote generically so that it could be mapped to whatever output

snake is just a list of coordinates

the food is just a coordinate

there's no assumption about the game board. the print function just maps these objects on the fly to draw a board. you can easily map to something like an arduino instead (which was the original purpose of this)
